# Khievs-Note-Taker 
  ## Description
  This  is  an application that can take the users notes and save them for future use. Could be used as reminders or as an agenda for the day. I was motivated to create this application as I am a very forgetful person. I built this so I would no longer forget my tasks anymore.
